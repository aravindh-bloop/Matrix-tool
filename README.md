![Matrix Operations Demo](demo.gif) *[Screenshot/Animation placeholder]*

A powerful GUI application for performing matrix operations using Python, NumPy, and PyQt5. Designed for students, engineers, and mathematicians working with linear algebra.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**:
  - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
  - Transpose, Inverse, Determinant
  - Rank, Trace, Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors
  - Identity/Zero matrix generation

- **Matrix Management**:
  - Manual input via intuitive grid
  - Random matrix generation
  - File import/export (CSV, TXT)
  - Result storage and reuse

- **User Interface**:
  - Modern dark theme
  - Real-time matrix display
  - Operation history log
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Responsive design

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

Documentation
Supported Operations
Operation	Requirements	Notes
Addition	Same dimensions	A + B
Multiplication	Compatible dimensions	A × B
Transpose	Any matrix	Aᵀ
Determinant	Square matrix only	det(A)
Inverse	Square, non-singular	A⁻¹
Eigenvalues	Square matrix	Returns complex values
Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

PyQt5 installation fails:

bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install PyQt5 --pre
Matrix dimension errors:

Verify matrices meet operation requirements

Check console for specific error messages

File loading issues:

Ensure files use consistent delimiters

Verify all rows have equal columns
